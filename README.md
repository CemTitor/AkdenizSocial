# Akdeniz Social




A social media application that can only be used by Akdeniz University students, in the style of Instagram, written using flutter and firebase and provider package


In this project, I aim to create social media platform, It can only be used by Akdeniz University students. Thus, people outside the university will not be able to use the application and there will be only posts within the university. 

In this application, students will be able to post stories from their profiles and they will be able to follow each other and talk to each other. There will be a group messaging feature. It will be seen when the shared posts were shared. When students log in with their student mail, verification code will be required. Shares can be liked and commented on.




The people who will use the project will of course be those who student in the Akdeniz University. As for the benefits of the project:
The impact and purpose of the project are to enable students on campus to communicate using this application.

In future studies, it can be group messaging for communities for students, or opening a topic about a certain topic and making comments about it there (like https://eksisozluk.com).
